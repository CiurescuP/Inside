# Inside
A picture inside some text.
Had no idea you could insert a picture inside a text so when I thought about it, I immediately starting coding. With a few lines of HTML and CSS, I brought it to life. Coding's fun! 
There's a contrast problem to it, I know, but this is for FUN ONLY. If it were done professionally, I most likely would choose different images.
